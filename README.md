![Framework Overview](images/framework.png)

<!-- This repository contains the implementation of our approach STFT and several other algorithms like [FGFA](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_iccv_2017/html/Zhu_Flow-Guided_Feature_Aggregation_ICCV_2017_paper.html), [RDN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.09511), and [MEGA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.12063) based on [mega.pytorch](https://github.com/Scalsol/mega.pytorch), as well as some pretrained models to reproduce the results on Endoscopic Video Datasets and ImageNetVID reported in our paper.
